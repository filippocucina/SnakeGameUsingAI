Pygame represents images as Surface Objects. The display.set_mode() function creates a new surface object 
that represents the actual displayed graphics. Any drawing you do to this Surface will become on the monitor.

Drawing of images is handled by the Surface.blit() method. A blit basically means copying pixel colors from one 
image to another. We pass the blit method a source Surface to copy from, and a position to place the source onto 
the destination.

Para usar Variables Constantes, debes usar la palabra reservada global
EX: 
		date = '10-07-2001'

		def get_date():
			global date
			date = '10-07-2001'
